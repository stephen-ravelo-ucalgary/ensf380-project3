# ensf380-project3

NOTE: no need to compile (just make sure you have the "Extension Pack for Java" extension)
To run a test (Windows):
1. while writing code make sure your working directory is the project folder "ensf381-project3"
    - I believe this allows it to update the classes in the bin folder so this is necessary
2. cd to the bin folder
3. open command prompt
4. java -cp .;COPY-lib-FOLDER-PATH\* org.junit.runner.JUnitCore edu.ucalgary.oop.TestName
    - (Don't forget the \* after the lib path)
